        <h1>Profile</h1>
        <p>
            The profile page allows users to manage their profile picture, username, friends, points, recent activity
            and tasks. If chosen, the user may make this page fully private. In order to add friends in person, users
            can scan one another's QR Code. If the users intend on adding each other online, they may choose to do so
            by using the â€œFind Friends'' tool that helps the user find other people via Username or full name. Moreover,
            the user may also view their recent activity by week. The chart is a visual for users to interpret how active
            they have been during the week. "My tasks" allows users to enter any tasks they might have for a given day.
            "My Tasks" was implemented in order to reduce poor time management.
