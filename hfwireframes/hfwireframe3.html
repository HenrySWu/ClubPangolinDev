        <p>
            The feed page offers a social aspect that keeps our users engaged and excited to use the application.
            Outside of just exercising people can use our product as a social outlet to connect, catch up and view
            other's public activity. On this page users can view other user's posts, achievements, who they sent
            rewards to, other user's favorite purchases and much more public information. The feed page helps keep
            our users engaged. By implementing a social aspect we wanted to build a community of users with the same
            interests.
