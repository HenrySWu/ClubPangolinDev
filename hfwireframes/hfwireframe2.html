        <h1>Achievements Rewards</h1>
        <p>
            You can access this screen by clicking on the center-lower icon. This page serves as a large indicator
            of a user's personal achievements and rewards. In this page users can track their personal achievements
            and view various rewarding actions. At the top of this page, users can view their overall achievement status.
            Below their "Exercise Achievement" lists all types of rewards. In this high-fidelity wireframe "Coupon A",
            "Coupon B", … represent different monetary rewards. In place of these placeholders our product will list all
            possible discounts to local eateries within a certain distance. Each “Coupon” will have a set amount of points
            that you can redeem or send to one another. In order to reduce clutter we limited this page to two core features.
