        <p>
            This action is featured on “My Map”. By clicking the pinned question mark, users can learn more about
            the business and choose to support local community members. The “more information” action displays the
            community member who owns the business, their story, the distance the business is away from the user
            and more background information. Some users will find this useful as they only want to support local
            shops instead of large franchises or corporations.
