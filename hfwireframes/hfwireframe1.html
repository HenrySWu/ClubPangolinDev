        <h1>The Login Page</h1>
        <p>
            This page's primary focus is to ensure users who don't have an account, to create one by clicking
            "New User?". Moreover, if the user has an existing account they can enter their user name in the "USERNAME"
            open text box and password in the "PASSWORD" open text box. Once both fields are filled accordingly,
            the user may click the blue arrow indicating to move forward. If the credentials are valid, the user will
            be moved to the next screen. If the credentials are not valid, the user may create a new account ("New User?")
            or will be prompted to reset credentials. In order to keep this page minimal and unique we decided to feature
            our core mascot potato as a centerpiece in hopes of drawing attention to new users and creating a user friendly
            platform.
