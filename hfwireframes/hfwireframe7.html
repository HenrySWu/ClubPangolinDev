            Messages include individual direct messages and group messages. In order to meet up with other people with similar
            goals we have developed a design for users to do so safely. Through our application users may create conversations
            in order to earn points with or redeem points for each other. Many users may find this feature a great way to meet
            new people who share common interests.
