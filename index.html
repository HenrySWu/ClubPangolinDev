<h2>Design Challenge</h2>
<p>With the prolonged onset of the pandemic, work from home and virtual schooling have become standard
   in what many call our “new normal”. However, this has led many to sit for hours at a time, putting
    them at risk of developing a myriad of health conditions that have been shown to increase overall mortality.
</p>
</div>

<div class="page_section">
  <h2>Problem Scope & Impact</h2>
  <p>So, just how dangerous is sitting for too long?</p>
  <p>It turns out that “physical inactivity is now the 4th leading risk factor for global mortality, causing an
     estimated 3.2 million deaths a year” (Just Stand).</p>
  <p>Studies show that of an average 16-hour waking day, many adults spend about 12.3 hours engaging in sedentary
     behavior (CNN Health). That’s about 77% of their day, everyday!</p>
  <p>Considering an inactive lifestyle can also lead to an increased risk for obesity, heart disease,
     high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and other diseases,
      sitting for prolonged periods of time will negatively impact the health of millions worldwide (Medline Plus).</p>

  <h2>Problem Statement & Solution</h2>
  <p>After some research into the general activity levels of everyday Americans as well as the recommended
     activity levels to maintain health, our team settled on the following goal post for our users in our
      problem statement.</p>
  <p>How can we encourage college students who sit for more than 1.5 hours at a time to walk at least 7
     miles (cumulative) per week?</p>
  <p>Our solution is an app that focuses on motivating individuals to start exercising by walking or biking
     to both avoid users from sitting too long and to help them build healthier habits. In return for
      exercising, the app will award users with points they can use to redeem coupons or deals from local businesses.</p>

  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  <p>To get a better idea of what solutions already exist, our team decided to conduct a competitive analysis.
     We examined a variety of solutions such as mobile apps, gyms, gamification systems, and more. The chart
      below depicts what solutions we looked into as well as a summary of our findings. Clicking on the
       hyperlinks at the bottom of each column will lead to a more detailed analysis of each solution.</p>

  <h2>User Research</h2>
  <p>At first we wanted to target and interview adults who sat for a long period of time as a general group,
     however, we soon decided on college students and new graduates as our main demographic. This is largely
      because this population would be the most accessible to our team.</p>
  <p>Our team interviewed twelve people of varying ages & fitness levels to gather as much information as
     possible. Here are some highlights of what we learned from these interviews.</p>
  <p><img width="100%" src="images/interview_highlights.png"></p>
</div>

<div class="page_section">
  <h2>Interview Analysis</h2>
  <p>To make sense of the information gathered, our team decided to create an Affinity Diagram to search
     for common sentiments and experiences from our interviews. Our team decided to use MiroBoard to create
      this diagram, which can be explored below.</p>

<div class="page_section">
  <h2>Key Insights</h2>
  <p>From the Affinity Diagram, we were able to discover multiple shared themes amongst the interviews which helped
     generate and inform our key insights. In addition, our key insights are also supported by academic research
      that will be incorporated into our design.</p>
  <p>Here is a short summary of our key findings.</p>

  <h1>Solution Development</h1>
  <p>In developing design ideas for our solution, our team created storyboards, sketches, and various
     wireframes to help visualize our app.</p>
</div>

<div class="page_section">
  <h2>Storyboards</h2>
  <p>We used storyboards to put ourselves in the shoes of our users. We explored various use cases for
     our solution and the tool helped visualize the interactions and feelings of users as they used the
     solution.</p>
</div>

<div class="page_section">
  <h2>Storyboard One</h2>
  <p>This storyboard describes a person (Joe) going through the same routine day after day, eventually
     becoming tired and bored, with little energy. They look for a way to make themselves feel better
     and find our app. They feel better by changing up their routine with exercise.</p>
  <p><img width="100%" src="images/storyboard_1_zach.jpg"></p>
</div>

<div class="page_section">
  <h2>Storyboard Two</h2>
  <p>This storyboard describes a person (Bob) who codes for hours everyday at their desk and then plays
     video games afterwards to relax. Bob gets a notification from our app about a new coupon and invites
     a friend to run with him. After exercising, Bob earns points on our app and is able to claim the new
     coupon. He goes to Gamestop with his friend to use the coupon.</p>

  <h2>Storyboard Three</h2>
  <p>This storyboard describes a person (Sarah) who has been studying for hours for her midterm with no break.
     She usually bikes everyday but feels tired and wants to skip a day. She checks our app and sees that her
     friend has a three day exercise streak. Not wanting to lose to her friend, Sarah decides to take a break
     and bike for 15 minutes. She earns her own three day streak and is happy about her accomplishments.</p>
