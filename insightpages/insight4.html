    <h1>Key Insight</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Users want to track and be rewarded for exercising but are limited by tools’ traditional definitions of
        exercise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Depth of Insight</h2>
    <br>

    <h3>User Needs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We hope that users can better understand the sports they usually do. Monitor daily physical activity and
        reward users with incentives to do more exercise to stay fit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Users hope that the software can collect more kinds of sports data, such as cycling, climbing, swimming and so
        on.</li>
      <br>
      <li>At the same time, based on these achieved sports goals, get some rewards. Incentivize users to follow through
        with rewards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Users are encouraged to maintain exercise habits while receiving rewards, rather than disrupting the user’s
        fitness program or terminating the user’s fitness program.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Some sports are difficult to measure accurately, such as weight-bearing anaerobic training, trampoline, rock
        climbing, etc.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Inappropriate rewards lower users’ expectations for prizes.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>“The most successful intervention, though, turned out to be giving people the equivalent of 9 cents’ worth of
        reward points if they returned to the gym after missing a planned workout.”</li>
      <br>
      <li>Through research on gym fitness, it has been found that the way to make people more involved in fitness and
        exercise is to give a certain amount of rewards. This method is much better than just the effects and advantages
        of popular science fitness.</li>
      <br>
      <img src="../images/insight4.png">
      <br><br>
      <li>Most sports trackers for wearable devices are not cheap, and accurate tracking devices require users to invest
        a lot of money.</li>
      <br>
      <li>If the user simply uses the mobile phone software to track the movement, it will become very inconvenient to
        wear and track.</li>
