      <li>“techniques designed to enhance one's personal productivity seem to exacerbate the very anxieties they were
        meant to allay”</li>
      <br>
      <li>Applications that promote “personal productivity” are considered as techniques that can “exacerbate” stress
        and anxiety linked to task management seen highly in college students.</li>

      <li>“Impact of Time Management Behaviors on Undergraduate Engineering Students' Performance.” SAGE Open, vol. 9,
        no. 1, 2019, p. 215824401882450. <a

      <br>
      <li>O'Connell (2014) also suggests that the balance between sleep, exercise, and appropriate diet alongside an
        increase in “downtime” would lead to a decrease in student illness, therefore suggesting the link between time
        management and physical health."</li>
      <br>
      <li>Exercise is linked to promoting healthy habits that decrease “student illness”. By implementing exercise into
        student's lives we may decrease student's stress.</li>

      <li>"Once classes begin and my Google calendar gradually becomes a multicolored depiction of the overcommitted
        college student, all that working-out momentum I build up over the long break tends to peter out, and exercise
        time gets squeezed out by other responsibilities."</li>
      <br>
      <li>University of North Carolina states that exercise shouldn't require a large amount of time. We can learn to
        incorporate exercise seamlessly into our daily tasks. Managing what to do during task breaks can help improve
        time management as well as relieve stress.</li>
