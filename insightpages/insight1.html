        Exercise Is Promoted when Individual Performance Affects the Group: A Test of the Kohler Motivation Gain Effect.
        ann. behav. med. 44, 151-159 (2012). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12160-012-9367-4">https://doi.org/10.1007/s12160-012-9367-4</a></li>

      <li>This research paper concluded that “across sessions, conjunctive condition participants exercised
        significantly
        longer (M=21.89 min, SD=±10.08 min) than those in coactive (M=19.77 min, SD=± 9.00 min) and individual (M=10.6
        min,
        SD=±5.84 min) conditions (p&#600.05)”, which is also supported by Figure 1 below.</li>

      <li>This research paper concluded that “in those recruited alone
        and given SBT [(standard behavioral treatment)], 76% completed treatment and 24% maintained their weight loss in
        full from Months 4 to 10 … [while] among those recruited with friends and given SBT plus social support, 95%
        completed treatment and 66% maintained their weight loss in full.”</li>
