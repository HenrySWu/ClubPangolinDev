<p>This storyboard describes a person (Bob) who codes for hours everyday at their desk and then plays
    video games afterwards to relax. Bob gets a notification from our app about a new coupon and invites
    a friend to run with him. After exercising, Bob earns points on our app and is able to claim the new
    coupon. He goes to Gamestop with his friend to use the coupon.</p>
